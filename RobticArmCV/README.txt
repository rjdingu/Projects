Project : Robotic Hand Controlled by Hand Gesture Using Arduino Nano

Description : 
    This project implements a real-time hand gesture–controlled robotic arm using computer vision and embedded systems. 
    A webcam captures hand movements, which are processed using OpenCV to detect and track gestures. 
    The processed gesture data is transmitted to an Arduino Nano via serial communication. 
    The Arduino Nano then controls four servo motors to move a robotic gripper arm according to the detected hand gestures.
    This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision, human–machine interaction, and embedded hardware control.


Applications :
      Industrial automation
      Assistive robotics
      Contactless control systems
      Educational robotics and embedded learning
